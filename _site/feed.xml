It will hopefully end up encompassing several areas  of my life to be an accurate representation of me. This means stream-of-consciousness posts, links to my favorite videos, pretty pictures from math and computing, and  maybe even allusions to my hobbies of D&amp;D and music performance. Hope you enjoy!</subtitle><entry><title type="html">First Post!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2018/06/04/first-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Post!" /><published>2018-06-04T10:26:16-05:00</published><updated>2018-06-04T10:26:16-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2018/06/04/first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2018/06/04/first-post.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello! Welcome to my site. This is a very new experience for me, and especially in the early days of this site it’ll probably be all over the place as I figure out what I want it to become. Right now I’m leaning towards showcasing the intersection of math and computer science with art (in all its forms), which probably means it’ll be me making some stuff I think is cool and then sharing it. I hope it will give others ideas for fun stuff they can do and also serve as a motivation for me to actually act on all my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to update the About page, so I’ll say a little about myself here. I’m a math and computer science major at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, about to begin my fourth and final year there. I am also currently pursuing both a music minor and flute performance certificate. I tend to think my life passions can be summarized in four words: math, computers, music, and games/puzzles. I guess maybe that was actually five or six words, depending on how you counted.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently interning at Fermilab National Accelerator Lab outside Chicago, IL, where I am part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Computing Division. Last year, the first optical counterpart of a gravitational wave event was observed by the DES team, and since we expect the number of events to increase almost tenfold in the next observational run, the hope is that I will make the image processing pipeline ten times faster over these twelve weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ll try and also keep updating this site! Thanks for stopping by!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hello! Welcome to my site.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
