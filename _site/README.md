# Multilingual Site

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) and Sylvain Durand's multilingual Jekyll theme (found [here](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/jekyll-multilingual)). I also use my friend Josh's [post metadata script](https://github.com/jyn514/jyn514.github.io/blob/master/scripts/new_post).

To spin up a local server running these files, type
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
