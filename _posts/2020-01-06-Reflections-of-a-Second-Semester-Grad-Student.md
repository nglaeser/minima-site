Take a look at some advice out there  
Link to possibly other good analyses, and then try to tailor mine to fill gaps I see.  
Disclaimer: this is for anxious perfectionists.  

## Things I learned by doing that would have been nice to know at the start

- Reading papers takes practice. I'd heard it a lot of times before, but it gets noticably easier fairly quickly once you start doing it a lot every day. If you can get in this habit as an undergrad, many things will be a lot easier for you, including (obviously) reading papers once in grad school but also just the process of applying to graduate school and figuring out what areas you may be interested in, because you'll start noticing patterns in authors and topics you enjoy reading about.
- Sign up for research credits
- Don't obsess about how many hours of work you put in; what's more important is your output, and the direct way to influence that is by creating an environment for yourself in which you thrive. This means self-care! How much sleep you need, figure out what environment you work best in (music vs. silence vs. background noise, cooped up alone vs. surrounded by others who are working in your office vs. a coffee shop or a common area, etc.), go to the gym, join activities that you find interesting, motivating, and intellectually stimulating, and engage with the community to form a support network.
    - I learned during this time that I need a solid 9 hours of sleep. That's a little on the high end - some people wake up naturally after far less - but figure it out for yourself by taking a couple of weeks or so over the break in which you consistently go to bed at the same time and see when you wake up. You may sleep a lot the first couple of days (if you're recovering from a bad sleep schedule in particular) but it will eventually stabilize and you'll get your answer.
- At the start, in particular if you don't have an exact research topic in mind yet, you may want a more hands-on professor to just assign you projects to try. You may need to be straightforward and ask for him/her to employ your preferred style.
    - Don't put too much pressure on yourself to find the "perfect project" and worry one paper or work will completely define your career. It won't (check out how many professors theses are not even related to what they do now...). You have to get your feet wet and try things to find out whether or not you like them. You should especially focus on questions that motivate you, regardless of the particular tools necessary for the job. Find something you care about answering and you'll be on a good path. As long as you keep asking questions, one thread can be pulled at for a very long time and lead to some interesting and unexpected research.
- Counseling! The transition to grad school is a big one, in particular coming from a US undergraduate program, which are generally very hands-on and guided. Your main focus now is research and self-guided exploration, and the autonomy can come as kind of a shock and lead to a bit of an identity crisis :) You'll likely be moving to a completely new place as well, have to make completely new friends, and handle very new responsibilities (like TAing). Imposter syndrome can really kick in. If you're someone who likes to work through your problems by talking to someone, counseling can be a very good outlet.
- Don't cut yourself off from the campus and community! Engage, or you'll be lonely and miserable.
- In your first semester/year (and maybe more), go to as many talks as you reasonably can, in as many areas as you can. Try to go even if you think you would never be interested in an area - a good speaker and work may convince you otherwise. Conversely, don't discount a topic on the basis of a single talk. (Usually your department will curate a calendar of talks, e.g. [talks.cs.umd.edu/](https://talks.cs.umd.edu/) at UMD.)
- At the beginning, make sure you sign up to mailing lists you are interested in so you'll be aware of events
- Talk to people. Including about research. (Within reason; you need to leave some time to actually work, too.) If your department has weekly coffee hours or mingling events or similar things, you should check it out. It'll also help it be less intimidating.
- Put a system in place for reading articles. Install a citation manager for articles you read; decide on a highlighting color scheme (which colors correspond to what); store summaries, questions, thoughts, key terms, next steps, etc. in a note with each article.
- Advisor is there to assist you in *your* research; find a topic you are passionate about that overlaps with their research, but it doesn't have to be exactly something they are already working on. 
- Some good questions, maybe: "Why do you like your area?"

## Materials

- *Deep Work* by Cal Newport
- A notebook for scratch paper. I like having one with perforated graph paper sheets so I can tear pages out easily.
