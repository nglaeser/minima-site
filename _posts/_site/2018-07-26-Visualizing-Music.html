<p>As my first (real) post on this site, I want to share a project I did for my flute studio last semester. But first, a little background:</p>

<h4 id="the-music">The Music</h4>
<p>Francis Poulenc (1899-1963)<a href="#references">[1]</a> was a French pianist and composer whose work is a staple in classical flute repertoire. He wrote many sonatinas and other accompanied pieces for flute, all several pages long, but one piece stands out: a solo flute piece called <a href="../../../files/Poulenc.pdf">“Un joueur de flûte berce les ruines”</a> (“A flute player lullabies the ruins”). The piece is uncharacteristically short – only one page, four lines, thirteen bars – and is thus a perfect building block to inspire more art.</p>

<h4 id="the-math">The Math</h4>
<p>Fractals are one of the most artistic parts of mathematics. In their simplest form, they are geometric shapes which resemble themselves at different scales, that is, you can zoom in forever and keep seeing the same patterns. An example you may have come across before is the Sierpinski Triangle:<br />

Notice that, on a large scale, the whole triangle consists of four smaller triangles. But if you look at the top triangle, you can see that it is in fact a Sierpinski Triangle itself, just scaled down to one-fourth the size of the full fractal!</p>

<p>Many natural phenomena have fractal-like features – snowflakes, pineapples, and proteins, to name a few. To me, this is one of the indicators that mathematics truly is the language of the universe.</p>

<h4 id="the-cs">The CS</h4>
<p>There are plenty of programs and sites on the Internet that can help you create your own fractal. One such site is Ludger Sandig’s <a href="http://lsandig.org/cgi-bin/apollon/index.cgi">Apollonian Gasket Generator</a>. This is actually simply an online version of his command-line program <a href="https://github.com/lsandig/apollon">apollon</a> on GitHub, which I downloaded and used for this project.</p>

<h4 id="the-cool-stuff">The Cool Stuff</h4>
<p>So how does all of this fit together?</p>

<p>The task at hand was to use Poulenc’s short piece as a starting point for another work of art.</p>
