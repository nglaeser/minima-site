Paper-reading is rarely taught but always expected. Early in grad school, someone linked me to Srinivasan Keshav's [short paper on how to read a paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf), which was very helpful. 

S. Keshav describes what he calls the "three-pass approach". Though the paper is really short (two pages), I'll summarize the strategy here in the hopes that this will make more people aware of its existence. I've also added my own take in a couple places. I'd like this to serve as a reference sheet when reading papers, to remind you what to focus on with each pass.

My understanding of how best to read a paper is always evolving, so this is a living document and I'll update it as I learn more.

## The First Pass

**Goal:** Get a high-level understanding of what the paper is about.  
**Time:** 5-10 minutes.  
**Sections:** Title, abstract, introduction, section headings, conclusion, quick glance over references

<div style="width: 100%">
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass1-1.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with title, abstract, and introduction highlighted"/>
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass1-2.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with section headers highlighted"/>
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass1-3.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with conclusion and references highlighted"/>
</div>

What's the "meat" of the paper, the key insight? If you were to present it, what would be the one thing you would spend the middle of your talk on? You don't have to understand it yet, just single it out so you don't get distracted from it when you dive deeper.

## The Second Pass

**Goal:** Understand the main thrust of the paper.  
**Time:** Up to 1 hour.  
**Sections:** Figures and diagrams, section contents (skip details like proofs)

<div style="width: 100%">
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass2-1.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with figures and section text highlighted"/>
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass2-2.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with section text and theorem statement highlighted (but not its proof)"/>
</div>

In the second pass, you can start taking notes on the central sections of the paper. Focus on understanding the techniques and findings. 

Although my initial instinct was to highlight and take notes of every detail, I've found that it's better to only write down key points and make comments in the margins as they come to you. You can also concisely summarize each section so that you have a roadmap of the paper if you need to return to it after some time away.

## The Third Pass

**Goal:** Attempt to reimplement the paper in your head and understand possible future work.  
**Time:** 4-5 hours for a beginner, 1 hour for an experienced reader.  
**Sections:** All the details

<div style="width: 100%">
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass3-1.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with proof highlighted"/>
<img src="../../../files/read-paper/pass3-2.jpg" style="width: 30%" alt="Page with proof highlighted"/>
</div>

In this pass you're looking for a really deep understanding of the work. Why did they use the techniques they did? Do you see problems with their approach? What does research imply about the rest of the field, both in how it connects to it and how it will change it going forward?

## A Fourth Pass?

After getting into the nitty-gritty, I usually need to zoom back out once more and remind myself of the point of this paper. What was the core of the paper, the main idea the authors had that they then constructed the paper around? Why should I care about it? If I'm presenting it, why should others care about it?

## Conclusion

Depending on what you want out of a paper, you don't have to do all the passes. If you are just perusing a research area or trying to find a paper that's worth your time, you may only apply the first pass to many papers before deciding on one to dig into. If you're presenting a paper to a reading group or class, on the other hand, you certainly need to do two passes at the very least. If you're going to build on a paper for your research, you'll need to do the same, and do a deep-dive Ã  la third pass for the most relevant sections, if not the entire paper.

Happy reading!
