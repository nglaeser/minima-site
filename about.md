Hello! My name is Noemi and at the time of this writing I am a rising senior at the University of South Carolina Honors College. I am double-majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science and minoring in Music with a flute performance certificate. 

Since I was little I loved making things with my hands. It forced me to be a creative and effective problem-solver and yielded a concrete end product that I could be proud of. I lost a little of that hobby as I grew older, but I hope this site will reawaken some of that.  Enjoy!
